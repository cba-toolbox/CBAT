Import the downloaded JZIP file into JATOS. For JATOS setup instructions, please refer to this [link](https://www.jatos.org/Installation.html).

Note: As of October 2025, downloads may be very slow or time out due to server-related issues. We are planning to fix this in the future.

## Modifying Tasks and JATOSIFY

While you can use the tasks from CBAT as they are, you may also wish to make some modifications. In that case, select the desired tasks and click "DL (ZIP)" to download the ZIP file. Unzip the downloaded file and make the necessary modifications.

Enter the "Title" and "JATOS version", then upload the ZIP file you just created. The file will then be converted into a JATOS-importable format (JZIP) and downloaded. Import the downloaded JZIP file into JATOS.
