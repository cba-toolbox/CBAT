The registration of the Registration Applicant as a Registered User shall be deemed completed upon the association’s issuance of this notification.\nUpon the completion of the registration as defined

Terms.\nThe Association may refuse registration or re-registration if the Registration Applicant falls under any of the following circumstances and shall bear no obligation to disclose the reasons:\n\n\nAny or all of the Registration Information provided to the Association is false, contains errors, or has omissions.\n\nThe applicant is a minor, an adult ward, a person under

necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll Intellectual Property Rights related to the Association Website and the Service belong to the Association or its licensors.

Registered Users shall not object to this use or disclosure.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Association may amend these Terms if deemed necessary.\nIn the event of any amendments, the Association will announce the effective date and details of the amended Terms by posting them on the Association’s website or by other appropriate means, or by notifying Registered Users.\nIf amendments to these Terms require the consent of Registered Users under applicable law, the Association shall obtain such consent through its prescribed methods.\nIf a Registered User logs into The Service after the notification of amendments (as stated in paragraph 2), the Registered User shall be deemed to have consented to the amendments.\n\n\n\n\n\nInquiries or other communications from Registered Users to the Association regarding the Service, as well as notifications or communications from the association to Registered Users regarding amendments to these Terms or otherwise, shall be made in accordance with the methods prescribed by the association.\nIf the Association sends communications or notices to the email address or other contact information included in the Registered User’s registration information, such communications or notices shall be deemed received by the Registered User.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegistered Users may not assign, transfer, pledge, or otherwise dispose of their contractual status under the Terms, or their rights or obligations based on these Terms, to third parties without the prior written consent of the Association.\nIn the event that the Association transfers its business related to the Service to another entity, the Association may transfer the contractual status under the Terms, rights and obligations based on these Terms, as well as registration details and other customer information of Registered Users, to the transferee.
